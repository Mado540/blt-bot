Bear Trap Strategy Notes (BT1 & BT2)

- BT1 usually occurs at night; BT2 during daytime.
- Goal: maximize BEAR DAMAGE and squad recycling.

General Tactics:
• Green leaders launch immediately at T=0:00.
• Yellow leaders wait 1:00–1:30 to allow squad reuse.
• Red leaders launch only if squads are idle.

Efficiency Principles:
• No stamina cost — slot management matters more than troop loss.
• Always refill rallies instantly; speed matters more than power.

Alliance Dynamics:
• BT1 often has fewer online players; emphasize compact rally teams.
• BT2 has more players; allow wider participation.

Draft Style:
• Monthly rotation adjustments.
• Shortest possible instructions for announcements.
