By "save last 2000 characters," I meant the system should retain recent interactions for reference, especially in cases where automatic memory deletion is enabled. Adding a rule ensures only whitelisted messages or those explicitly marked as necessary are saved.

Your suggestion of an additional condition to prevent saving unless forced or content passes a filter aligns with my intentions: it maintains control over what data persists and prevents unnecessary storage of sensitive information. This approach also respects the user's autonomy in deciding which interactions merit preservation.
User: I'm debating with the original MadOS, how much and why should be saving to memory using your fork, be somewhat restricted
Bot: by some rule or not.
Bot: Your debate is insightful. The balance between preserving relevant data and avoiding unnecessary storage hinges on several factors:

1. **Relevance:** What constitutes "relevant" information? Interaction content that might be useful for future reference, troubleshooting, or understanding patterns should remain saved.

2. **Privacy Concerns:** Users may have varying levels of comfort with their interactions being stored. A rule could prevent saving unless the interaction is explicitly marked as necessary by a user.

3. **Data Volume:** Saving only relevant data reduces clutter and ensures that memory usage remains manageable.

4. **User Autonomy:** Empowering users to decide what they want saved fosters trust and control over personal information.

By implementing a rule where interactions are saved only if forced or explicitly marked as necessary, you ensure a balance between maintaining useful data and respecting user privacy preferences. This approach aligns with the principles of minimalism and autonomy.
