Bear Trap Doctrine:
- GREEN leaders: mados, MilkTea, PEiPEi, Call me Al.
- YELLOW leaders: JellyFlakes, Nebroy16, Stephan, BiGJaYHeN.
- RED leaders: <none listed yet>.
- Start with only GREEN rallies at T=0:00.
- YELLOW launches at T=+1:00–1:30.
- RED launches only if idle squads exist at T=+2:30–3:00.
- BT has no stamina cost; limiting factor is rally reuse.
- Always recycle top 2–3 squads (Tier S).
